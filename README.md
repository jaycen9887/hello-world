Creating my first Git Repository

I am trying to learn git as well as other languanges to broaden my skills. I am hoping to be a software enginneer in time. I am going to be putting in the work, I know it wont be easy, but this is something that I really want to do. So....here we go!

This is me doing another edit just to make sure I remember how. 

I do believe that I can do this.
